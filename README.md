This repo contains a website that was probably originally written
sometime in 2006, when I was fourteen.

Parts of the source appear to be completely lost, but I am posting the
remainder for posterity.


Its function was as a profile/blog/etc. site for Second Life. Not too
dissimilar from today's web profiles, really. Its existence may have
been inspired by the removal of (negative?) ratings, or maybe not. I do
not recall.

Features included:

- Basic profiles
- Custom fields in your profiles
- An avatar image
- Indication of whether you were online in Second Life
- Real time chat that worked in-world
- A forum (written from scratch, the source long lost)
- A Twitter-esque microblogging service, with image support
- A profile view designed for embedding in the old 'web' tab of
  profiles.
- Support for receiving pictures from Second Life by email
  (trust me, this made sense in 2006)
- A WordPress-based blog hosting service (the SSO part is still
  here; the WordPress modifications are long lost)
- Some variety of in-world support that I could probably find if
  I went looking.
- A documented API.
- An OS X Dashboard widget that told you which of your friends were
  online and let you chat with them. The source can be found in 
  tslpchat.zip.
- More?

I have attempted to remove information from this dump that shouldn't be public.

This sort of thing is what I did when I was a young teenager. I was probably
very proud of it at the time. Enjoy!
